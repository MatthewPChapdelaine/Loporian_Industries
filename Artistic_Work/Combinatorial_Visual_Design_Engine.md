# Combinatorial Visual Design Engine for Comic Books

Executive Summary
A fractal, rule-governed design system that generates visual reference materials across all scales of comic book creation—from narrative structure and scene composition down to individual visual elements. The engine maps design possibility space, enabling artists to explore and synthesize variations within deterministic constraint systems. Output is never a finished product, but always reference material for human artistic decision-making.

## 1. Vision & Principles

### Core Premise
The engine operates on the same combinatorial logic across all scales of comic creation, like a snowflake's self-similar fractal structure. A narrative arc follows the same tension-resolution grammar as a single panel, which follows the same visual balance principles as color palette relationships.

### Design Philosophy
- **Deterministic, not generative:** Rules and constraints produce output, not statistical models or randomness
- **Attribution-native:** All sources (constraint rules, reference systems, visual precedents) are traceable
- **Artist-augmenting, not artist-replacing:** Output serves as reference and exploration tool; human artists make all creative decisions
- **Nested and scalable:** Every component operates at multiple fractal levels simultaneously
- **Possibility mapping:** The engine explores the design space; artists navigate it

## 2. System Architecture

### Hierarchical Layers

The engine operates across six primary scales, each following combinatorial logic:

#### Layer 1: Narrative Structure
- **Atoms:** Narrative beats (inciting incident, rising action, climax, resolution)
- **Rules:** Story tension curves, character arc progressions, thematic resonance
- **Combinations:** Multi-arc series designs, subplot weaving, continuity constraints
- **Output:** Narrative blueprints; branching story graphs; arc sequences

#### Layer 2: Scene & Pacing
- **Atoms:** Scene types (exposition, confrontation, revelation, transition)
- **Rules:** Emotional pacing, information density, reader rhythm
- **Combinations:** Scene sequencing within issues; act structures; dramatic timing
- **Output:** Scene outlines; pacing diagrams; dramatic curve specifications

#### Layer 3: Panel Composition
- **Atoms:** Panel arrangements (single, grid, splash, irregular)
- **Rules:** Visual flow (left-to-right, reading weight, eye path)
- **Combinations:** Page layouts; panel progression logic; visual grammar across pages
- **Output:** Layout specifications; composition templates; visual rhythm maps

#### Layer 4: Character & Pose
- **Atoms:** Pose primitives (stance, gesture, expression, line of action)
- **Rules:** Body mechanics, emotional expression, character silhouette consistency
- **Combinations:** Character through-action; pose sequences; body language conversations
- **Output:** Pose libraries; character movement studies; emotional state maps

#### Layer 5: Visual Elements
- **Atoms:** Design primitives (shape, proportion, symmetry, line weight)
- **Rules:** Harmony relationships, visual balance, design consistency
- **Combinations:** Costume designs, prop variations, environment assemblies
- **Output:** Design variations; component libraries; visual specification sheets

#### Layer 6: Chromatic & Textural
- **Atoms:** Color values, texture primitives, material relationships
- **Rules:** Harmonic color theory, material coherence, atmospheric effect
- **Combinations:** Palette sets; lighting scenarios; material variation suites
- **Output:** Color palettes; texture libraries; lighting reference documents

### Cross-Layer Integration
Each layer feeds information to adjacent layers. Narrative structure constraints panel composition; character pose constraints costume variation; scene pacing determines panel density. Constraints propagate bidirectionally
